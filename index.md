# Privacy Policy for Personal Rclone Google Drive Integration

**Effective Date:** 2025/10/03  
**Last Updated:** 2025/10/03

## Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how my personal integration app 'rclone-goodrive' ("the App") uses information when connecting Google Drive with my local computer via rclone. The App is designed exclusively for personal use to synchronize a specific work folder on my PC with a designated backup folder in my Google Drive.

## Information Collected

**Google Account Access:** The App requests access to Google Drive through OAuth 2.0 in order to read and write files in the backup folder.

**Data Types:** The App only accesses file metadata (such as file names, sizes, and timestamps) and file contents strictly for the purpose of synchronization.

**Personal Data:** The App does not collect, store, or share personal information, including names, email addresses, contacts, or any Google user profile data.

**Scope of Access:** The App requests limited Google Drive permissions specifically for file management in designated folders only.

## How Information Is Used

*   Files and metadata are used only for backup and sync between the local PC folder and Google Drive.
*   No information is shared with third parties.

## Data Storage and Retention

**Storage Locations:**
*   On the local computer where the App runs.
*   In the user's own Google Drive account.
*   The App itself does not store any files or data on external servers.

**Retention Period:** Files are retained indefinitely until manually deleted by the user. No automatic deletion occurs.

**Access Tokens:** Authentication tokens are stored locally on the user's machine following rclone's security standards.

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

*   The App does not share, sell, or transfer data to any third party.
*   Data remains private between the user's PC and the user's Google Drive.
*   No external services or analytics platforms are used.

## Security Measures

*   Authentication uses Google OAuth 2.0 for secure login and permissions management.

## User Rights and Control

*   Full control over which folders are synchronized.

**Data Portability:** Users maintain complete ownership and control of their files at all times.
